          <p>
            [tftp] If a callback (which performs the file access in
            the TFTP server) takes too long time (more than the
	    double TFTP timeout), the server will abort the
            connection and send an error reply to the client. This
	    implies that the server will release resources attached
            to the connection faster than before. The server simply
            assumes that the client has given up.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] If the TFTP server receives yet another request
            from the same client (same host and port) while it
            already has an active connection to the client, it will
            simply ignore the new request if the request is equal
            with the first one (same filename and options). This
            implies that the (new) client will be served by the
            already ongoing connection on the server side. By not
            setting up yet another connection, in parallel with the
            ongoing one, the server will consumer lesser resources.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] netascii mode is now supported when the
            client/server has native ascii support (Windows). The new
            optional parameter native_ascii in the tftp_binary and
            tftp_file callback modules can be used to override the
            default behavior.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] Yet another callback module has been added in
            order to allow customized handling of error, warning and
            info messages. See the new configuration parameter,
            logger.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] Yet another configuration parameter, max_retries,
            has been added in order to control the number of times a
            packet can be resent. The default is 5.</p>
          <p>
            [tftp] tftp:info/1 and tftp:change_config/2 can now be
            applied to all daemons or all servers in one command
            without bothering about their process identifiers.</p>

            [tftp] Blocks with too low block numbers are silently
            discarded. For example if a server receives block #5 when
            it expects block #7 it will discard the block without
            interrupting the file transfer. Too high block numbers
            does still imply an error. External TR HI96072.</p>

            has been enhanced, but there is no supervisor report in

            The Inets application now has to be explicitly started
            and stopped i.e. it will not automatically be started as
            a temporary application as it did before. Although a
            practical feature when testing things in the shell it is
            not desirable that people take advantage of this and not
            start the Inets application in a correct way in their
            products. Added functions to the Inets API that call
            application:start/stop.</p>
