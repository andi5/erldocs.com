        <item>
	    <p>Mostly internal changes, in particular to the event
	    protocol; fixes problems with timeouts that could cause
	    eunit to hang, and makes it much easier to write new
	    reporting back-ends.</p>
	    <p>New "surefire" report backend for Maven and
	    Bamboo.</p>
	    <p>The test representation is no longer traversed twice
	    (the first pass was for enumeration only). This
	    eliminates some strange restrictions on how generators
	    can be written, but it also means that reports cannot be
	    quite as complete as before in the event of skipped
	    tests.</p>
